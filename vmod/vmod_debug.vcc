$Synopsis auto
DESCRIPTION
===========

This vmod is used to develop, test and debug the various aspects
of VMOD handling in Varnish.


$Event event_function

You are not supposed to be able to see this text in the .RST

$Function STRING author(ENUM { phk, des, kristian, mithrandir } person="phk",
			ENUM { phk, slink, geoff } someone='phk')

Test function for ENUM arguments

$Function VOID test_priv_call(PRIV_CALL)

Test function for call private pointers

$Function VOID test_priv_vcl(PRIV_VCL)

$Function VOID test_priv_task_get()

Assert that the priv_task for the NULL pointer is NULL.

$Function STRING test_priv_task(PRIV_TASK, STRING s="")

Test function for TASK private pointers

$Function STRING test_priv_top(PRIV_TOP, STRING)

Test function for TOP private pointers

$Object obj(STRING string="default", ENUM { one, two, three } number=one)

Test object

Fail for string="fail".

.. NOTE: .enum before .foo as part of test r01332.vtc
$Method VOID .enum(ENUM { phk, des, kristian, mithrandir, martin })

Testing that enums work as part of object and that the parser isn't
(too) buggy.

$Method VOID .obj()

Covering the fact that a method can be named like the constructor.

$Method STRING .string()

getter for string

getter for number

$Method STRING .foo(STRING why)

Foo indeed.

$Method TIME .date()

You never know when you need a date.

$Method VOID .test_priv_call(PRIV_CALL)

Test method for call private pointers

Objects share the ``PRIV_*`` state with other objects and methods from
the same vmod - IOW the ``PRIV_*`` state is per vmod, not per object.

$Method VOID .test_priv_vcl(PRIV_VCL)

Test method for VCL private pointers

Objects share the ``PRIV_*`` state with other objects and methods from
the same vmod - IOW the ``PRIV_*`` state is per vmod, not per object.

$Method STRING .test_priv_task(STRING s="")

Test per-object priv_task via VRT_priv_task() / VRT_priv_get()

$Method STRING .test_priv_top(STRING s="")

Test per-object priv_top via VRT_priv_top()

$Restrict client

$Function VOID rot104()

Try to register the rot52 filter again. This should always fail
the vcl.

$Function VOID rot52(HTTP hdr)

Encrypt the HTTP header with quad-ROT13 encryption,
(this is approx 33% better than triple-DES).

$Function STRING argtest(
	  STRING one, REAL two =2, STRING three= "3",
	  STRING comma=",", INT four = 4,
	  [ STRING opt])

$Function INT vre_limit()

$Function VOID register_obj_events(PRIV_VCL)

Register the vmod to receive expiry callbacks

$Function VOID fail()

Function to fail vcl code.  (See also: RFC748)

$Function BOOL fail2()

Function to fail vcl code. Always returns true.

$Object dyn(STRING addr, STRING port, PROBE probe=0, BACKEND via=0)

Dynamically create a single-backend director, addr and port must not be empty.

$Method BACKEND .backend()

Return the dynamic backend.

$Method VOID .refresh(STRING addr, STRING port, PROBE probe=0, BACKEND via=0)

Dynamically refresh & (always!) replace the backend by a new one.

$Object dyn_uds(STRING path)

Dynamically create a single-backend director listening at a Unix
domain socket, path must not be empty.

$Method BACKEND .backend()

Return the dynamic UDS backend.

$Method VOID .refresh(STRING path)

Dynamically refresh & (always!) replace the backend by a new UDS backend.

$Function VOID vcl_discard_delay(PRIV_VCL, DURATION)

Hold a reference to the VCL when it goes cold preventing
discard for the given delay.

$Function ACL null_acl()

Return no acl.

Return the argument.

$Function BOOL match_acl(ACL acl, IP ip)

Perform an IP match against a named ACL.

$Function BLOB sweep_acl(ACL acl, IP ip0, IP ip1, INT step = 1)

Sweep `acl` through IP#s `ip0` ... `ip1` and return a hash-signature
of the results.

VSL_Debug lines will be emitted for every 64 addresses (you probably want:
`-p vsl_mask=+Debug,-VCL_acl`

Only the lower 64 bits of IPv4 addresses are stepped.

$Function DURATION time_acl(ACL acl, IP ip0, IP ip1, INT step = 1, INT rounds = 1000)

Time `rounds` sweeps from `ip0` to `ip1` through `acl`.

Consider: `-p vsl_mask=-VCL_acl`

$Object aclobj(ACL)

$Method ACL .get()

$Function VOID test_probe(PROBE probe, PROBE same = 0)

Only here to make sure probe definitions are passed properly.

$Function VOID vsc_new()

Add a vsc

$Function VOID vsc_count(INT val = 1)

Update counter

$Function VOID vsc_destroy()

Remove a vsc

$Object concat(STRANDS)

Create an object that returns the string formed by concatenating the
given strings.

$Method STRING .get()

Return the string formed from the concatenation in the constructor.

$Function STRING concatenate(STRANDS)

Return the string formed by concatenating the given strings.
(Uses ``VRT_StrandsWS()``.)

$Function STRING collect(STRANDS)

Return the string formed by concatenating the given strings.
(Uses ``VRT_CollectStrands()``.)

$Function VOID sethdr(HEADER, STRANDS)

Set the given header with the concatenation of the given strings.

$Function DURATION priv_perf(INT size, INT rounds=10000)

Benchmark ``VRT_priv_task()`` with `size` elements, iterating `rounds`
times.

Returns the average time taken for each call scaled up from
nanoseconds to seconds - iow the value given as seconds is actually
the duration in nanoseconds.

For comparable results, a higher size run should called first and
discarded.

$Object NULL_OK obj_opt(PRIV_CALL, PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK,
		[STRING s], [BOOL b])

Test object constructor with all the fancy stuff.

$Method STRING .meth_opt(PRIV_CALL, PRIV_VCL, PRIV_TASK,
			 [STRING s], [BOOL b])

and actual values appear in the logs. Not currently implemented for backend
transactions.

$Restrict client backend

$Function VOID store_ip(IP)

Store an IP address to be later found by ``debug.get_ip()`` in the same
transaction.

$Function IP get_ip()

Get the IP address previously stored by ``debug.store_ip()`` in the same
transaction.

$Function STRING resolve_range(STRING addr, [STRING def_port], [STRING fail_port])

Resolve addr and return the result. If addr has a port range, all successfully
resolved sockets are retuned in a comma delimited string. If fail_port is
specified, the resolution callback will fail for that port, and the reason will
be appended to the return value.

$Alias .bar obj.foo

Bar was wrong, it was definitely foo.
