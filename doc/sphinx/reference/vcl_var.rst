VCL Variables
-------------

Variables provide read, write and delete access to almost all aspects
of the work at hand.

Reading a variable is done simply by using its name in VCL::

    if (client.ip ~ bad_guys) {
	return (synth(400));
    }

Writing a variable, where this is possible, is done with a ``set``
statement::

    set resp.http.never = "Let You Down";

Similarly, deleting a variable, for the few variables where this is
possible, is done with a ``unset`` statement::

    unset req.http.cookie;

Which operations are possible on each variable is described below,
often with the shorthand "backend" which covers the ``vcl_backend_* {}``
subroutines and "client" which covers the rest, except ``vcl_init {}``
and ``vcl_fini {}``.

When setting a variable, the right hand side of the equal sign
must have the variables type, you cannot assign a STRING to
a variable of type NUMBER, even if the string is ``"42"``.
(Explicit conversion functions can be found in
:ref:`vmod_std(3)`).

local, server, remote and client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These variables describe the network connection between the
client and varnishd.

Without PROXY protocol::

	     client    server
	     remote    local
	       v          v
	CLIENT ------------ VARNISHD


With PROXY protocol::

	     client    server   remote     local
	       v          v       v          v
	CLIENT ------------ PROXY ------------ VARNISHD

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend

	The IP address (and port number) of the local end of the
	TCP connection, for instance ``192.168.1.1:81``

	If the connection is a UNIX domain socket, the value
	will be ``0.0.0.0:0``

local.endpoint	``VCL >= 4.1``

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client, backend

	The address of the '-a' socket the session was accepted on.

	If the argument was ``-a foo=:81`` this would be ":81"

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client, backend

	The name of the '-a' socket the session was accepted on.

	If the argument was ``-a foo=:81`` this would be "foo".

	Note that all '-a' gets a default name on the form ``a%d``
	if no name is provided.

remote.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend

	The IP address of the other end of the TCP connection.
	This can either be the clients IP, or the outgoing IP
	of a proxy server.

	If the connection is a UNIX domain socket, the value
	will be ``0.0.0.0:0``

client.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend


	The client's IP address, either the same as ``local.ip``
	or what the PROXY protocol told us.

client.identity

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client


	Identification of the client, used to load balance
	in the client director.  Defaults to ``client.ip``

	This variable can be overwritten with more precise
	information, for instance extracted from a ``Cookie:``
	header.


server.ip

	Type: IP

	Readable from: client, backend


	The IP address of the socket on which the client
	connection was received, either the same as ``server.ip``
	or what the PROXY protocol told us.

	Writable from: vcl_backend_response, vcl_backend_error

	Default: ``default_keep`` parameter.

	Set to a period to enable conditional backend requests.

	The keep time is cache lifetime in addition to the ttl.

	to issue conditional (If-Modified-Since / If-None-Match)
	requests to the backend to refresh them.


beresp.backend

	Type: BACKEND

	Readable from: vcl_backend_response, vcl_backend_error

	This is the backend we fetched from.  If bereq.backend

	Hint to Varnish that you want to save this object to a
	particular storage backend.

beresp.filters

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: vcl_backend_response

	Writable from: vcl_backend_response

	List of Varnish Fetch Processor (VFP) filters the beresp.body
	will be pulled through. The order left to right signifies
	processing from backend to cache, iow the leftmost filter is
	run first on the body as received from the backend after
	decoding of any transfer encodings.

	VFP Filters change the body before going into the cache and/or
	being handed to the client side, where it may get processed
	again by resp.filters.

	The following VFP filters exist in varnish-cache:

	* ``gzip``: compress a body using gzip

	* ``testgunzip``: Test if a body is valid gzip and refuse it
	  otherwise

	* ``gunzip``: Uncompress gzip content

	* ``esi``: ESI-process plain text content

	* ``esi_gzip``: Save gzipped snippets for efficient
	  ESI-processing

	  This filter enables stitching together ESI from individually
	  gzipped fragments, saving processing power for
	  re-compression on the client side at the expense of some
	  compression efficiency.

	Additional VFP filters are available from VMODs.

	By default, beresp.filters is constructed as follows:

	* ``gunzip`` gets added for gzipped content if
	  ``beresp.do_gunzip`` or ``beresp.do_esi`` are true.

	* ``esi_gzip`` gets added if ``beresp.do_esi`` is true
	  together with ``beresp.do_gzip`` or content is already
	  compressed.

	* ``esi`` gets added if ``beresp.do_esi`` is true

	* ``gzip`` gets added for uncompressed content if
	  ``beresp.do_gzip`` is true

	* ``testgunzip`` gets added for compressed content if
	  ``beresp.do_gunzip`` is false.

	After beresp.filters is set, using any of the beforementioned
	``beresp.do_*`` switches is a VCL error.

obj

	The storage backend where this object is stored.


obj.can_esi

	Type: BOOL

	``vcl_deliver {}`` would cause the response body to be ESI
	processed.


resp
~~~~

This is the response we send to the client, it is built from either
``beresp`` (pass/miss), ``obj`` (hits) or created from whole cloth (synth).

With the exception of ``resp.body`` all ``resp.*`` variables available
in both ``vcl_deliver{}`` and ``vcl_synth{}`` as a matter of symmetry.

resp

	Type: HTTP

	Readable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	The entire response HTTP data structure, useful as argument
	to VMODs.

resp.body

	Type: BODY

	Writable from: vcl_synth

	To produce a synthetic response body, for instance for errors.

resp.proto	``VCL <= 4.0``

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	Writable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	The HTTP protocol version to use for the response.

resp.proto	``VCL >= 4.1``

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	More information in the `HTTP response status`_ section.

	resp.status 200 will get changed into 304 by core code after
	a return(deliver) from vcl_deliver for conditional requests
	to cached content if validation succeeds.

	For the validation, first ``req.http.If-None-Match`` is
	compared against ``resp.http.Etag``. If they compare equal
	according to the rules for weak validation (see RFC7232), a
	304 is sent.

	Secondly, ``req.http.If-Modified-Since`` is compared against
	``resp.http.Last-Modified`` or, if it is unset, against the
	point in time when the object was last modified based on the
	``Date`` and ``Age`` headers received with the backend
	response which created the object. If the object has not been
	modified based on that comparison, a 304 is sent.

	Writable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	Default: obj.can_esi

	This can be used to selectively disable ESI processing,
	even though ESI parsing happened during fetch.
	This is useful when Varnish caches peer with each other.

	It is a VCL error to use resp.do_esi after setting resp.filters.


resp.is_streaming

	Type: BOOL

	Readable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	Returns true when the response will be streamed
	while being fetched from the backend.

resp.filters

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	Writable from: vcl_deliver, vcl_synth

	List of VDP filters the resp.body will be pushed through.

	Before resp.filters is set, the value read will be the default
	filter list as determined by varnish based on resp.do_esi and
	request headers.

	After resp.filters is set, changing any of the conditions
	which otherwise determine the filter selection will have no
	effiect. Using resp.do_esi is an error once resp.filters is
	set.

Special variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

now

	Type: TIME

	Readable from: all


	The current time, in seconds since the UNIX epoch.

	When converted to STRING in expressions it returns
	a formatted timestamp like ``Tue, 20 Feb 2018 09:30:31 GMT``

sess
~~~~

A session corresponds to the "conversation" that Varnish has with a
single client connection, over which one or more request/response
transactions may take place. It may comprise the traffic over an
HTTP/1 keep-alive connection, or the multiplexed traffic over an
HTTP/2 connection.

sess.xid	``VCL >= 4.1``

	Type: STRING

	Readable from: client, backend

	Unique ID of this session.

sess.timeout_idle

	Type: DURATION

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client

	Idle timeout for this session, defaults to the
	``timeout_idle`` parameter, see :ref:`varnishd(1)`

sess.timeout_linger

	Type: DURATION

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client

	Linger timeout for this session, defaults to the
	``timeout_linger`` parameter, see :ref:`varnishd(1)`

sess.send_timeout

	Type: DURATION

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client

	Total timeout for ordinary HTTP1 responses, defaults to the
	``send_timeout`` parameter, see :ref:`varnishd(1)`

sess.idle_send_timeout

	Type: DURATION

	Readable from: client

	Writable from: client

	Send timeout for individual pieces of data on client
	connections, defaults to the ``idle_send_timeout`` parameter,
	see :ref:`varnishd(1)`

storage
~~~~~~~

storage.<name>.free_space

	Type: BYTES

	Readable from: client, backend


	Free space available in the named stevedore. Only available for
	the malloc stevedore.


storage.<name>.used_space

	Type: BYTES

	Readable from: client, backend


	Used space in the named stevedore. Only available for the malloc
	stevedore.


storage.<name>.happy

	Type: BOOL

	Readable from: client, backend


	Health status for the named stevedore. Not available in any of the
	current stevedores.

HTTP response status
--------------------

A status code normally has 3 digits XYZ where X must be between 1 and 5
included. Since it is not uncommon to see HTTP clients or servers relying
on non-standard or even invalid status codes Varnish tolerates any status
between 100 and 999.

With VCL code it is possible to use status codes in the form XXYZZ where the
overall value is lower than 65536 and the Y digit is between 1 and 9 included.
Only the YZZ part is sent to the client.

The XXYZZ form of status codes can be set on ``resp.status`` and
``beresp.status`` or passed via ``return(synth(...))`` and
``return(error(...))`` transitions.

XX can be therefore be used to pass information around inside VCL, for
instance ``return(synth(22404))`` from ``vcl_recv{}`` to ``vcl_synth{}``.

The ``obj.status`` variable will inherit the XXYZZ form, but in a ban
expresion only the YZZ part will be available. The XXYZZ form is strictly
limited to VCL execution.

Assigning an HTTP standardized code to ``resp.status`` or ``beresp.status``
will also set ``resp.reason`` or ``beresp.reason``  to the corresponding
status message.
