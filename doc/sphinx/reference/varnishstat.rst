SYNOPSIS
========

varnishstat [-1] [-x] [-j] [-f field_list] [-l] [-n varnish_name] [-N filename] [-V] [-w delay]

DESCRIPTION
===========

The varnishstat utility displays statistics from a running varnishd(1) instance.

The following options are available:

-1          Instead of presenting of a continuously updated display, print the statistics to stdout.

-f          A comma separated list of the fields to display.  If it starts with '^' it is used as an exclusion
	    list.

-l          Lists the available fields to use with the -f option.

-n          Specifies the name of the varnishd instance to get logs from.  If -n is not specified, the host name
	    is used.

-N          Specify a the filename of a stale VSM instance. When using this
            option the abandonment checking is disabled.

-V          Display the version number and exit.

-w delay    Wait delay seconds between updates.  The default is 1. Can also be used with -1, -x or -j for repeated output.

-x          Displays the result as XML.

-j          Displays the result as JSON.

The columns in the main display are, from left to right:

1.   Value
2.   Per-second average in the period since last update, or a period if the value can not be averaged
3.   Per-second average over process lifetime, or a period if the value can not be averaged
4.   Descriptive text

When using the -1 option, the columns in the output are, from left to right:

1.   Symbolic entry name
2.   Value
3.   Per-second average over process lifetime, or a period if the value can not be averaged
4.   Descriptive text

When using the -x option, the output is::

  <stat> 
    <name>FIELD NAME</name> 
    <value>FIELD VALUE</value> 
    <description>FIELD DESCRIPTION</description> 
  </stat> 

With -j the output format is::

  {
    "timestamp": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:SS",
    "client_conn": {
	"value": 0, "flag": "a", 
	"description": "Client connections accepted"
    },
    "client_drop": {
	"value": 0, "flag": "a", 
	"description": "Connection dropped, no sess/wrk"
    },
    "LCK.backend.creat": {
	"type": "LCK", "ident": "backend", "value": 1, 
	"flag": "a", "description": "Created locks"
    },
    [..]
  }

Timestamp is the time when the report was generated by varnishstat.

Repeated output with -1, -x or -j will have a single empty line (\\n) between each block of output.
