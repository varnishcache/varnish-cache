Welcome to Varnish's documentation!
===================================

Varnish is a state of the art web accelerator. Its mission is to sit
in front of a web server an cache the content. It makes your web site
go fast.

We suggest you start by reading the :ref:`install-index`. Once you
have Varnish up and running go through the :ref:`tutorial-index`.
