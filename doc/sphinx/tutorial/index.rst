Using Varnish
%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This tutorial is intended for system administrators managing Varnish
cache. The reader should know how to configure her web- or application
server and have basic knowledge of the HTTP protocol. The reader
should have Varnish up and running with the default configuration. 

The tutorial is split into short chapters, each chapter taking on a
separate topic. Good luck.
