Installing on Debian/Ubuntu
===========================

From package
------------

Type::

	sudo apt-get install varnish


Official packages of 6
----------------------

Starting from Varnish Cache 5.0, we've simplified our packaging down to two:
the main package and a development package.

The official Varnish Cache repository is now hosted at Packagecloud.io.
Note that while Packagecloud.io provides Bash Script installs, we recommend
using the manual installation procedures.

Instructions for installing the official repository which contains the newest
Varnish Cache 6 release are available at:

* https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish60lts/install#manual-deb

With the release of 6.0.2, users have to switch to switch repositories to get
the latest version.
Read more about this on `Release 6.0.2 </releases/rel6.0.2>`_.


Official packages of 4.1
------------------------

To use Varnish Cache 4.1 packages from the official varnish-cache.org repos,
follow the instructions available at:

* https://packagecloud.io/varnishcache/varnish41/install#manual-deb
