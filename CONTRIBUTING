Contributing to Varnish Cache
=============================

Official development tree is here:

    https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache

These days we prefer patches as pull requests directly to that tree.

Bugreports go there too.

Our main project communication is through our developer IRC channel::

	#varnish-hacking on server irc.linpro.no

(That channel is not for user questions, use the #varnish channel for that.)

Mondays at 15:00 EU time we hold our weekly "bugwash" where we go
through new (and old) tickets.  It speeds things up a lot if you
can join the channel and answer questions directly when we go over
the ticket.

GitHub pull requests
--------------------

Pull requests are handled like other tickets.

Trivial pull requests (fix typos, etc) are welcomed, but they may be committed
by a core team member and the author credited in the commit message.

For anything non trivial, please take Jens Axboe's excellent contributing guide
as guidance: https://github.com/axboe/liburing/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

Notable differences for Varnish-Cache are:

* For code style, we broadly follow bsd style(9) https://man.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=style&sektion=9

* Regarding commit messages, we are usually less strict

* The Varnish-Cache repository uses a linear history, so all changes are rebased
  on top of the current upstream head always. When your PR can no longer be
  merged, rebase it and force-push your changes.

* For testing `make distcheck` should pass
