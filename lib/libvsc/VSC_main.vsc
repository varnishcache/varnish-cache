.. varnish_vsc:: n_test_gunzip
	:oneliner:	Test gunzip operations

	Those operations occur when Varnish receives a compressed object
	from a backend. They are done to verify the gzip stream while it's
	inserted in storage.


.. varnish_vsc:: http1_iovs_flush
	:oneliner:	Premature iovec flushes

	Number of additional writes performed on HTTP1 connections
	because the number of IO vectors was too small to submit all
	possible IO in one go. This number is configured through the
	``http1_iovs`` parameter for client connections and implicitly
	defined by the amount of free workspace for backend
	connections.
