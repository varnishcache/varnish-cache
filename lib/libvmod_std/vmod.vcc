$Module std 3 Varnish Standard Module

DESCRIPTION
===========

`vmod_std` contains basic functions which are part and parcel of Varnish,
but which for reasons of architecture fit better in a VMOD.

One particular class of functions in vmod_std is the conversions functions
which all have the form::

	TYPE type(STRING, TYPE)

These functions attempt to convert STRING to the TYPE, and if that fails,
they return the second argument, which must have the given TYPE.

$Function STRING toupper(STRING_LIST s)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to uppercase.
Example
	set beresp.http.scream = std.toupper("yes!");

$Function STRING tolower(STRING_LIST s)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to lowercase.
Example
	set beresp.http.nice = std.tolower("VerY");

$Function VOID set_ip_tos(INT tos)

Description
	Sets the IP type-of-service (TOS) field for the current session
	to *tos*.
	Please note that the TOS field is not removed by the end of the
	request so probably want to set it on every request should you
	utilize it.
Example
	| if (req.url ~ "^/slow/") {
	|	std.set_ip_tos(0);
	| }

$Function REAL random(REAL lo, REAL hi)

Description
	Returns a random real number between *lo* and *hi*.
Example
	set beresp.http.random-number = std.random(1, 100);

$Function VOID log(STRING_LIST s)

Description
	Logs the string *s* to the shared memory log, using VSL tag
	*SLT_VCL_Log*.
Example
	std.log("Something fishy is going on with the vhost " + req.http.host);

$Function VOID syslog(INT priority, STRING_LIST s)

Description
	Logs the string *s* to syslog tagged with *priority*. *priority*
	is formed by ORing the facility and level values. See your
	system's syslog.h file for possible values.
Example
	std.syslog(9, "Something is wrong");

	This will send a message to syslog using LOG_USER | LOG_ALERT.

$Function STRING fileread(PRIV_CALL, STRING)

Description
	Reads a file and returns a string with the content. Please
	note that it is not recommended to send variables to this
	function the caching in the function doesn't take this into
	account. Also, files are not re-read.
Example
	set beresp.http.served-by = std.fileread("/etc/hostname");

$Function BOOL file_exists(STRING path)

Description
	Returns `true` if path or the file pointed to by path exists,
	`false` otherwise.
Example
	| if (std.file_exists("/etc/return_503")) {
	| 	return (synth(503, "Varnish is in maintenance"));
	| }

$Function VOID collect(HEADER hdr)

Description
	Collapses multiple *hdr* headers into one long header.
	The header values are joined with a comma (",").

	Care should be taken when collapsing headers. In particular
	collapsing Set-Cookie will lead to unexpected results on the
	browser side.
Example
	std.collect(req.http.cookie);

$Function DURATION duration(STRING s, DURATION fallback)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to seconds. *s* must be quantified
	with ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), m (minutes), h (hours),
	d (days), w (weeks) or y (years) units. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	set beresp.ttl = std.duration("1w", 3600s);

$Function INT integer(STRING s, INT fallback)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to an integer. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	| if (std.integer(req.http.foo, 0) > 5) {
	|	...
	| }

$Function IP ip(STRING s, IP fallback)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to the first IP number returned by
	the system library function getaddrinfo(3). If conversion
	fails, *fallback* will be returned.
Example
	| if (std.ip(req.http.X-forwarded-for, "0.0.0.0") ~ my_acl) {
	|	...
	| }

$Function REAL real(STRING s, REAL fallback)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to a real. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	| if (std.real(req.http.foo, 0.0) > 5.5) {
	|	...
	| }

$Function INT real2integer(REAL r, INT fallback)

Description
	Converts the real *r* to an integer. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	set req.http.integer = std.real2integer(1140618699.00, 0);

$Function TIME real2time(REAL r, TIME fallback)

Description
	Converts the real *r* to a time. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	set req.http.time = std.real2time(1140618699.00, now);

$Function INT time2integer(TIME t, INT fallback)

Description
	Converts the time *t* to a integer. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	set req.http.int = std.time2integer(now, 0);

$Function REAL time2real(TIME t, REAL fallback)

Description
	Converts the time *t* to a real. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.
Example
	set req.http.real = std.time2real(now, 1.0);

$Function BOOL healthy(BACKEND be)

Description
	Returns `true` if the backend *be* is healthy.

$Function INT port(IP ip)

Description
	Returns the port number of the IP address *ip*.

$Function VOID rollback(HTTP h)

Description
	Restores the *h* HTTP headers to their original state.
Example
	std.rollback(bereq);

$Function VOID timestamp(STRING s)

Description
	Introduces a timestamp in the log with the current time, using
	the string *s* as the label. This is useful to time the execution
	of lengthy VCL procedures, and makes the timestamps inserted
	automatically by Varnish more accurate.
Example
	std.timestamp("curl-request");

$Function STRING querysort(STRING)

Description
	Sorts the query string for cache normalization purposes.
Example
	set req.url = std.querysort(req.url);

$Function VOID cache_req_body(BYTES size)

Description
	Cache the req.body if it is smaller than *size*.

	Caching the req.body makes it possible to retry pass
	operations (POST, PUT).
Example
	std.cache_req_body(1KB);

	This will cache the req.body if its size is smaller than 1KB.

$Function STRING strstr(STRING s1, STRING s2)

Description
	Returns a string beginning at the first occurrence of the string
	*s2* in the string *s1*, or an empty string if *s2* is not found.

	Note that the comparison is case sensitive.
Example
	| if (std.strstr(req.url, req.http.restrict)) {
	|	...
	| }

	This will check if the content of req.http.restrict occurs
	anywhere in req.url.

$Function TIME time(STRING s, TIME fallback)

Description
	Converts the string *s* to a time. If conversion fails,
	*fallback* will be returned.

	Supported formats:

	| "Sun, 06 Nov 1994 08:49:37 GMT"
	| "Sunday, 06-Nov-94 08:49:37 GMT"
	| "Sun Nov  6 08:49:37 1994"
	| "1994-11-06T08:49:37"
	| "784111777.00"
	| "784111777"
Example
	| if (std.time(resp.http.last-modified, now) < now - 1w) {
	|	...
	| }

$Function STRING getenv(STRING name)

Description
	Return environment variable *name* or the empty string.

	See getenv(3)
Example
	| set req.http.My-Env = std.getenv("MY_ENV");
