.Sh NAME
.Nm varnishtop
.Nd Varnish log entry ranking
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl 1
.Op Fl b
.Op Fl C
.Op Fl c
.Op Fl d
.Op Fl f
.Op Fl I Ar regex
.Op Fl i Ar tag
.Op Fl n Ar varnish_name
.Op Fl r Ar file
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl X Ar regex
.Op Fl x Ar tag
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility reads
.Xr varnishd 1
shared memory logs and presents a continuously updated list of the
most commonly occurring log entries.
With suitable filtering using the
.Fl I ,
.Fl i ,
.Fl X
and
.Fl x
options, it can be used to display a ranking of requested documents,
clients, user agents, or any other information which is recorded in
the log.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl 1
Instead of presenting of a continuously updated display, print the
statistics once and exit.
Implies
.Fl d .
.It Fl b
Include log entries which result from communication with a backend
server.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl C
Ignore case when matching regular expressions.
.It Fl c
Include log entries which result from communication with a client.
If neither
.Fl b
nor
.Fl c
is specified,
.Nm
acts as if they both were.
.It Fl d
Process old log entries on startup.
Normally,
.Nm
will only process entries which are written to the log after it
starts.
.It Fl f
Sort and group only on the first field of each log entry.
This is useful when displaying e.g.
.Dv stataddr
entries, where the first field is the client IP address.
.It Fl I Ar regex
Include log entries which match the specified regular expression.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl i Ar tag
Include log entries with the specified tag.
If neither
.Fl I
nor
.Fl i
is specified, all log entries are included.
.It Fl n
Specifies the name of the
.Nm varnishd
instance to get logs from.
If
.Fl n
is not specified, the host name is used.
.It Fl r Ar file
Read log entries from
.Ar file
instead of shared memory.
.It Fl V
Display the version number and exit.
.It Fl X Ar regex
Exclude log entries which match the specified regular expression.
.It Fl x Ar tag
Exclude log entries with the specified tag.
