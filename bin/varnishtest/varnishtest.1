.Op Fl q
.Op Fl v
.Ar file
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a script driven program used to test the varnish HTTP
accelerator.
.Pp
The
.Nm
program, when started and given one or more script files, can create a
number of threads representing backends, some threads representing
clients, and a varnishd process.
.Pp
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl n Ar iter
Run 
.Ar iter
number of iterations.
.It Fl q
Be quiet.
.It Fl v
Be verbose.
.It Ar file
File to use as a script
.El
.Sh SCRIPTS
.Ss Example script
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
# Start a varnish instance called "v1"
varnish v1 -arg "-b localhost:9080" -start

# Create a server thread called "s1"
server s1 {
    # Receive a request
    rxreq 
    # Send a standard response
    txresp -hdr "Connection: close" -body "012345\\n"
}

# Start the server thread
server s1 -start 

# Create a client thread called "c1"
client c1 {
   # Send a request
   txreq -url "/"
   # Wait for a response
   rxresp
   # Insist that it be a success
   expect resp.status == 200
}

# Run the client
client c1 -run

# Wait for the server to die
server s1 -wait

# (Forcefully) Stop the varnish instance.
varnish v1 -stop

.Ss Example script output
The output, running this script looks as follows.

If instead of 200 we had expected 201 with the line:
.Bd -literal -offset 4n
expect resp.status == 201
