Test-scripts for varnishtest
============================

Naming scheme
-------------

	The intent is to be able to run all scripts in lexicographic
	order and get a sensible failure mode.

	This requires more basic tests to be earlier and more complex
	tests to be later in the test sequence, we do this with the
	prefix/id letter:

		[id]%05d.vtc

	id ~ ^a		--> varnishtest(1) tests
	id ~ ^a02	--> HTTP2
	id ~ ^b		--> Basic functionality tests
	id ~ ^c		--> Complex functionality tests
	id ~ ^d		--> Director VMOD tests
	id ~ ^e		--> ESI tests
	id ~ ^f		--> Security related tests
	id ~ ^g		--> GZIP tests
	id ~ ^h		--> HAproxy tests
	id ~ ^j		--> JAIL tests
	id ~ ^l		--> VSL tests
	id ~ ^m		--> VMOD tests excluding director
	id ~ ^o		--> prOxy protocol
	id ~ ^p		--> Persistent tests
	id ~ ^r		--> Regression tests, same number as ticket
	id ~ ^s		--> Slow tests, expiry, grace etc.
	id ~ ^t		--> Transport protocol tests
	id ~ ^t02	--> HTTP2
	id ~ ^u		--> Utilities and background processes
	id ~ ^v		--> VCL tests: execute VRT functions
